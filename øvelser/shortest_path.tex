\textbf{Run the Bellman-Ford algorithm on the directed graph of Figure 24.4, using vertex $z$ as the source. Show the $d$ and $\pi$ values after each pass. Now, change the weight of edge $(z, x)$ to 4 and run the lagorithm again, using $s$ as the source}

\textbf{Prove Corollary 24.3} \\
Suppose there is a path from $s$ to $v$. Then there must be a shortest such path of length $\delta(s, v)$. It must have finite length since it contains at most $|V| - 1$ edges and each edge has finite length. By Lemma 24.2, $v.d = \delta(s, v) < \infty$ ipon termination.
